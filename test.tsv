2	Primary medical therapy for acromegaly: an open, prospective, multicenter study of the effects of subcutaneous and intramuscular slow-release octreotide on growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, and tumor size.	Conventional surgery and radiotherapy for acromegaly have limitations. There are few data on the use of the somatostatin analog octreotide (Oct) as primary medical therapy. An open prospective study of 27 patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly was conducted in nine endocrine centers in the United Kingdom. Twenty patients had macroadenomas, and 7 had microadenomas. For the first 24 wk (phase 1), patients received sc Oct in an initial dose of 100 microg, 3 times daily, increased to 200 micro g three times daily after 4 wk in the 13 patients whose mean serum GH remained greater than 5 mU/liter (2 microg/liter). Five-point GH profiles were performed at 0, 4, 12, and 24 wk, and high resolution pituitary imaging using a standard protocol was performed at 0, 12, and 24 wk (magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients and computed tomography in 2). Tumor dimensions and volumes were calculated by a central, reporting neuroradiologist, and the results were audited by a second, independent neuroradiologist. After 24 wk, 15 patients proceeded to phase 2 of the study with a direct switch to monthly injections of the depot formulation of Oct, Sandostatin long-acting release (Oct-LAR). Further GH profiles were performed at 36 and 48 wk, and pituitary imaging was performed at 48 wk. The median pretreatment serum GH concentration was 30.7 mU/liter (range, 6.7-141.4). During sc Oct, serum GH fell to less than 5 mU/liter in 9 patients (38%), and IGF-I fell to normal in 8 patients (33%). All 27 tumors shrank during sc Oct; for microadenomas the median tumor volume reduction was 49% (range, 12-73), and for macroadenomas it was 43% (range, 6-92). After 24 wk of Oct-LAR (end of phase 2), the GH level was less than 5 mU/liter in 11 of 14 patients (79%), and IGF-I was normal in 8 of 15 patients (53%). In the 15 patients given Oct-LAR (10 macroadenomas), wk 48 scans showed a further overall median tumor volume reduction of 24%. At the end of the study 79% of patients had mean serum GH levels below 5 mU/liter, 53% had normal IGF-I levels, and 73% showed greater than 30% tumor shrinkage. Twenty-nine percent of patients achieved all 3 targets, but no patient with pretreatment GH levels above 50 mU/liter did so at any stage of the study. Primary medical therapy with Oct offers the prospect of normalization of GH/IGF-I levels together with substantial tumor shrinkage in a significant subset of acromegalic patients. This is most likely to occur in patients with pretreatment GH levels less than 50 mU/liter (20 microg/liter).
3	Pasireotide versus continued treatment with octreotide or lanreotide in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly (PAOLA): a randomised, phase 3 trial.	BACKGROUND: Many patients with acromegaly do not achieve biochemical control despite receiving high doses of the first-generation somatostatin analogues octreotide or lanreotide. In the PAOLA trial, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of two different doses of the somatostatin analogue pasireotide long-acting release compared with active control (octreotide or lanreotide) in patients with inadequately controlled acromegaly. METHODS: In a multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial, we enrolled eligible patients aged 18 years or older with acromegaly who were inadequately controlled (5-point, 2 h mean growth hormone concentration >2·5 μg/L and insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] concentration >1·3 times the upper normal limit) and had received 30 mg octreotide long-acting repeatable or 120 mg lanreotide (Somatuline Autogel; Ipsen, UK) as monotherapy for 6 months or longer. We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1:1 ratio with an interactive voice-web response system to receive 40 mg pasireotide long-acting release once every 28 days for 24 weeks, 60 mg pasireotide long-acting release once every 28 days for 24 weeks, or continued treatment with octreotide or lanreotide (active control). Patients were stratified according to previous treatment (octreotide or lanreotide) and growth hormone concentrations at screening (2·5-10 μg/L and >10 μg/L). Patients and study investigators were not masked to study drug assignment but were masked to pasireotide dose allocation. The primary endpoint was number of patients achieving biochemical control, defined as mean growth hormone concentration less than 2·5 μg/L and normalised IGF-1 concentration. Efficacy analyses were based on intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01137682. FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2010, and Aug 6, 2012, 198 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to pasireotide 40 mg (n=65), pasireotide 60 mg (n=65), or active control (n=68) groups. At 24 weeks, ten (15%) patients in the pasireotide 40 mg group and 13 (20%) patients in the pasireotide 60 mg group achieved biochemical control, compared with no patients in the active control group (absolute difference from control group 15·4%, 95% CI 7·6-26·5, p=0·0006 for pasireotide 40 mg group, 20·0%, 11·1-31·8, p<0·0001 for pasireotide 60 mg group). The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia (21 [33%] for treatment with 40 mg pasireotide, 19 [31%] with 60 mg pasireotide, and nine [14%] with active control), diabetes (13 [21%], 16 [26%], and five [8%]), and diarrhoea (ten [16%], 12 [19%], and three [5%]); most were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Serious adverse events were reported in six (10%) patients in the pasireotide 40 mg group, two (3%) in the pasireotide 60 mg group, and three (5%) in the active control group. INTERPRETATION: Pasireotide provides superior efficacy compared with continued treatment with octreotide or lanreotide, and could become the new standard pituitary-directed treatment in patients with acromegaly who are inadequately controlled using first-generation somatostatin analogues.
